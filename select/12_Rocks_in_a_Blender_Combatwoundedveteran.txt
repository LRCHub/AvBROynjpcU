I'm a millenial and I hate my generation
I'm technically a Millennial and I fucking hate my generation.
I don't think I would say they "need safe spaces".
There is a sentiment of truth there but
That isn't the proper phrasing I would use.
Rather, I think Millennials are a consequence of the internet
Evolving to allow them 'safe spaces'
Without them even being aware of it.
It's a what-came-first situation.
Millennials aren't in safe space because they're a
Bunch of wimpy crying whining entitled shiftless morons.
They're wimpy crying whining entitled shiftless
Morons because they've grown up in safe spaces.
The internet used to be a lot more laissez-faire.
There was no such thing as social media (
I mean...
Xynga I guess?
) So you couldn't so easily "curate"
Your exposure to contrasting opinions.
The internet was centered around 'mega
Communities' like Something Awful, Newgrounds, etc.
Now, not only is every popular thing on the internet specifically
Designed around "curated experiences",
But frankly it seems like every fucking place you go on the internet,
It's now extremely commonplace to cry to every authority figure to
Try to get people banned for absurd reasons,
So you can permanently remove your exposure to 'wrong' opinions.
Reddit and Facebook are the best examples of this.
Hate conservatives?
Facebook will make sure you have nothing but an endless stream of
Insane propaganda flowing into your empty head,
Turning you into a screaming,
Gibbering hate-engine who can only
Communicate in talking points that were spoon fed to you.
Are you a fucking moonbat?
What a giant piece of shit you are.
Reddit even comes with a feature that lets you censure viewpoints you
Deem "wrong", and the behaviors of these vile shits is so predictable,
I'm under absolutely no allusions as to
What their reaction to this post is going to be.
I'll even downvote my own post to make
It easier for you crying little fucks.
