No, can't keep me down
Lost in my thoughts, feel like I could drown
Oh no, can't have it now
Buried so deep, I'm below the ground
I go, where I hear the sound
All on my own, I can feel it now
Unknown, so my heart pounds
'cause I don't understand what happens now
Oh no, I rest in peace
Leave behind a lesser me
Working hard to better me
Looking back, I'll never be
Let's go, recklessly
Fighting to forget it's me
I feel inside, it's festering
But I just want a better me
And you're the one that let me down
I'm looking at myself right now
The mirror nearly breaks it'self
I'm screaming out 'cause I need help
And you're the one that let me down
I'm looking at myself right now
The mirror nearly breaks it'self
I'm screaming out 'cause I need help
I try to forget
You held me back, soon as we met
You were always scared of what happens next
Unprepared, so you feared regret
I'm upset 'cause I wasted time
I sat at the base when I should've climbed
I stopped with the chase and forgot the grind
I feel out of place, empty inside
You thought I'd never be
Won't amount to anything
Had me doubting everything
You only knew a lesser me
You're now my enemy
Wish you never met with me
Work until the death of me
So I become a better me
And you're the one that let me down
I'm looking at myself right now
The mirror nearly breaks it'self
I'm screaming out 'cause I need help
And you're the one that let me down
I'm looking at myself right now
The mirror nearly breaks it'self
I'm screaming out 'cause I need help
