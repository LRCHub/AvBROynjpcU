Rip out your heart, rip out your soul
And carry you to where, rivers flow fucking blood
I cannot take your scent out from beneath my skin
Your vicious mind makes me bleed.
Ill hold you down, just by your time
I'll beat you dead; I'll lose control
Your bitter mind makes me bleed

Enter a fragment of my imagination
Enter a fragment of my mind
You ugly bitches will face their deaths
Where as my heart can't change it's path...
Without your spine
Hung by your wrists
Your tortured soul
Is forced to take one glimpse
Your mouth is stained with the most painful smile
Your flesh is crushed

You will be crawling away
From death you'll never be saved
Your time has been undone
Save me it, and rot in your grave
You will become like us

I will fuck your shell of life away
Bludgeoned in my eyes

Is my only wish
Death!
Enter a fragment of my imagination
You ugly bitches will face their deaths
Whereas my heart can't change its path
Without your spine
Hung by your wrists
Your tortured soul
Is forced to take one glimpse

Your mouth is stained with the most painful smile
Your flesh is crushed
You will have rot away, before angels can save your soul
You will become like us, those that kill for the thrill
You will become just like me
You!
Oh!
